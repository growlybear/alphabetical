alphabetical
============

Good question from Evan Hahn: [how many words in the English dictionary are alphabetical?](http://evanhahn.com/under-1-of-english-words-are-alphabetical/)

Evan used a dictionary with [58,115 words](http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html),
however I've used one with [109,583](http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/).
I've always liked to use more words ;-)
